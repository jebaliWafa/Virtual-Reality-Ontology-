# Virtual Reality Ontology  

## Overview  
This project presents an **Ontology for Virtual Reality (VR)**, designed using **RDFS** and extended with **OWL2** in **Protégé**.  
It models the core entities, relationships, and rules of immersive VR systems, including **users, avatars, devices, virtual environments, and objects**.

## Objectives  
- Represent the **concepts and relationships** of Virtual Reality.  
- Develop the ontology in **RDFS**, then enhance semantics using **OWL2**.  
- Ensure **consistency and reasoning** with axioms, SWRL rules, and SHACL constraints.  
- Enable **querying** through **SPARQL** for meaningful insights.  

## Methodology  
1. **Conceptual Design**: Brainstorming and modeling key VR concepts.  
2. **Ontology Development**:  
   - Defined classes, subclasses, and properties in **RDFS**.  
   - Converted to **OWL2** for richer semantics (equivalences, disjunctions, constraints).  
   - Implemented in **Protégé** with individuals, axioms, and annotations.  
3. **Rules & Constraints**: Applied **SWRL rules** and **SHACL constraints** to enforce logic and consistency.  
4. **Querying**: Used **SPARQL** to extract insights.  
5. **Visualization**: Generated ontology graphs with **RDF Grapher** and **OntoGraph**.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Protégé** (Ontology creation & reasoning)  
- **RDFS / OWL2** (Ontology languages)  
- **SWRL / SHACL** (Rules & constraints)  
- **SPARQL** (Querying ontology)  
- **RDF Grapher, OntoGraph** (Visualization)
